# Kurgan

This is a python markdown editor I made. It supports essential markdown features such as Headers, bold font, italic. Additionally it also supports website links and evalutaion of python code.
Also on the right side are permanent notes. This features was meant for TODO lists or something where it would be useful to see it all the time.
